    "Design a Bitcoin payment method for Emergent Coding agents.",

    "This payment method facilitates direct payments between agent contract customers and suppliers.",

    "Each agent utilises a single payment address from a Bitcoin Wallet. The wallet can be created from a mnemonic (command-line argument), or imported from a wallet file. The `wallet address index` is used to allocate a single `payment address` from the wallet. The use of a single address allows undisputed access to wallet coins between agents.",
    "Upon receiving an application `stop` signal, the wallet state will be saved to disk as a wallet file, overwriting any existing data.",
